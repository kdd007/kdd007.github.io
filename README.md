**Theme:** *Pictures of Things from Other Worlds*

## **Quest 1: Initiation into the Arcane Arts**

For my adventure, I set out to explore and discover fascinating things from different worlds through these mysterious portals. During my first exploration, I stumbled upon the world of *Pokemon*. As I peered through the portal, a large red crab suddenly charged at me! After some research, I discovered that the creature's name is **Crawdaunt** and it belongs to the Hoenn Region.  

Thus far, I am quite satisfied with my discovery of this world, and I may venture here again in the future!

### **Additional Notes:**

My original goal was to create the **Vietnamese flag** (a red flag with a bright yellow star in the middle). However, after rereading the directions, I realized I needed more shapes and colors. I added a bit of flair, and the design ended up resembling a *Pokemon* character. This led me to embrace the theme and expand the idea, ultimately creating the final picture with more detail and imagination.

## **Quest 2: Initiation into the Arcane Arts**

During my second adventure, I wandered through a portal and found myself on a **spaceship**! I asked the crew about my location, and they informed me that it was a parallel version of our universe.  

I had the incredible opportunity to take a picture of their **solar system**. I even saw a rocket floating through space and discovered that **Mercury** doesn't have a perfectly circular orbit. This was a surprising yet fascinating sight! Exploring both the spaceship and space itself was truly an unforgettable experience. I hope my next adventure takes me to a distant planet!

### **Additional Notes:**

- The only non-circular orbiting planet is **Mercury**.
