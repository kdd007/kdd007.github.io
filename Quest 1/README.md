Quest #1:
    For my adventure, I intend to go out and explore to discover cool things from different worlds through these mysterious portals. During my first exploration I have seemingly glanced into the world of Pokemon and while looking through the portal, a large red crab charged at me! Through more intensive research of the creature, I have discovered that the name of this creature is "Crawdaunt" in the Hoenn Region. Thus far, I am satisfied with my discovery of this world and I may venture here again. 

    My original goal was to create the Vietnamese flag(A red flag with a bright yellow star in the middle), but when I reread the directions, I realized that I needed more shapes and more colors so I ended up adding a little flair. Then I realized that it looked like a Pokemon and I ended up leaning into this idea to craft this picture.
